# USSD Code Challenge 
In this code challenge you will be required to make a USSD application that implements:
1. Mobile checkout with MPESA
2. Ability to send Airtime
3. SMS alert confirming airtime sent

### Workflow:
1. User initiates USSD code
2. User selects from the menu which should contain 
  1. Mobile checkout
  2. Send airtime option
3. If the user selects the mobile checkout, they should be able to pay via MPESA
4. If the user selects the send airtime option, they should be able to add how much they want to send and recieve an SMS that confirms airtime has been sent.
5. Add to the README.md a small guide of how to access your serive on the Simulator.
6. Ensure your service is accessible online. You can use the free tiers of [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) or other platform of choice.
